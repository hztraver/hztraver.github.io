    "text": "Hello! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia working with Team Shrub and Isla Myers-Smith. My research uses remote sensing technology across different spatial scales to understand climate-driven changes in vegetation across the Canadian arctic and sub-arctic. I enjoy working with spatial data and exploring creative forms of data visualization.\nOutside of work I love to play soccer, ultimate frisbee and spend time with my cat Henry.\nHana"

My PhD research also uses high-resolution drone imagery to map tree and shrub density and associate vegetation structure with soil organic carbon storage. We also use drone imagery to validate and understand better understand spectral patterns observed in moderate resolution satellite data.
