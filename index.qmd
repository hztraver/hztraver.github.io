Hello! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia working with Team Shrub and Isla Myers-Smith. My research uses remote sensing technology across different spatial scales to understand climate-driven changes in vegetation across the Canadian arctic and sub-arctic. I enjoy working with spatial data and exploring creative forms of data visualization.

Outside of work I love to play soccer, ultimate frisbee and spend time with my cat Henry.

Hana
