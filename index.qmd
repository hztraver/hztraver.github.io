Hello! I am PhD Candidate at the University of British Columbia under eh supervision of Dr. Nicholas Coops. My research uses remote sensing technology to understand climate-driven changes in vegetation across the Canadian arctic and sub-arctic.

Outside of work I enjoy playing soccer and ultimate frisbee and playing with my cat Henry.

Hana
